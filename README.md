Mini Game Console OS
Overview
The Mini Game Console OS is a Python-based operating system simulation designed to emulate a retro game console running classic games like Snake, Tetris, and Pong. It implements core OS conceptsâ€”process management, memory management, concurrency, and file systemsâ€”while incorporating creative bonus features to enhance user interaction and visualization. Built as a modular, multi-file project, it showcases an AI-based scheduler, paging-based memory allocation, threaded input processing, and real file I/O for game saves and logs, all wrapped in a retro-themed terminal UI.
Features

Process Management: AI-based Round Robin scheduler prioritizing less-played games (based on total runtime).
Memory Management: Paging system with 16 pages (1024 bytes each), supporting allocation and address translation.
Concurrency: Producer-Consumer threading model for game inputs (e.g., "up", "down") and score updates.
File System: Real file operations in a games/ directory, storing scores (e.g., snake.txt), high scores (high_scores.txt), and event logs (log.txt).
Retro Terminal UI:
ASCII art title and logo for a nostalgic console feel.
Colored menu (using colorama) with boxed messages.
Loading animations and countdown timers for game launches.

Visualizations:
ASCII queue display (e.g., [ Snake | Tetris ]).
Memory map with progress bar and allocated pages (e.g., [â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ----]).

Event Logger: Logs process events (e.g., start, termination) to games/log.txt with timestamps.
Sound Effects: Simulated retro sounds (e.g., "ðŸŽµ Key press!") printed for key events.

Prerequisites

Python 3.6+: Ensure Python is installed.
Colorama (Optional): For colored terminal output.pip install colorama

If not installed, the program falls back to plain text output.

Installation

Clone or download the project to a local directory:git clone <repository-url>
cd Mini_OS_Simulation

(Optional) Install colorama for enhanced visuals:pip install colorama

Ensure all project files are in the same directory (see Project Structure).

Running the Program

Navigate to the project directory:cd Mini_OS_Simulation

Run the main script:python main.py

Interact with the terminal UI:
Launch Game: Add a game process (e.g., Snake) with a specified burst time (1â€“20 seconds).
View Queue: See the current process queue in ASCII format.
View High Scores: Display high scores from games/high_scores.txt.
View Memory Map: Show allocated/free memory pages.
View Event Log: Read event logs from games/log.txt.
Run Scheduler: Execute the scheduler to simulate game processes.
Exit: Close the program.

Project Structure

main.py: Entry point, runs the retro UI and initializes components.
process_management.py: Defines PCB (Process Control Block) and Scheduler for process management and AI-based scheduling.
memory_management.py: Implements MemoryManager for paging and address translation.
concurrency.py: Contains GameThreadManager for Producer-Consumer threading.
file_system.py: Manages real file operations (create, read, write, delete) in the games/ directory.
bonus_features.py: Handles retro UI, memory map, progress bar, and loading animations.
utils.py: Utility functions for event logging, sound effects, input validation, and boxed messages.
README.md: Project documentation.
games/: Runtime directory for game files (e.g., snake.txt, log.txt).

Challenges Overcome

Circular Imports: Resolved by moving utility functions to utils.py and refactoring dependencies.
Thread Safety: Used locks (score_lock) for concurrent score updates and file writes.
Real File I/O: Implemented consistent file operations in games/ using pathlib.
User Experience: Added retro UI elements, animations, and input validation to enhance interactivity.
